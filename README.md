# Full-Stack Developer Journey

This repository documents my **15-month professional full-stack development journey**.  
Everything here is **project-based**, following real engineering principles, industry best practices, and production-ready workflows.  

## What’s Inside
- Progressive lessons from **HTML → CSS → JavaScript → React/Next.js → Backend → Databases → Full SaaS Architecture**
- **Capstone project:** Construction Project Management SaaS
- Hands-on tasks, engineering exercises, debugging experiments, and system design explorations
- Notes, mental models, and reflections for every lesson
- Git commit history reflecting professional development workflow

## Goal
To become a **job-ready full-stack engineer**, capable of building scalable, maintainable, enterprise-grade SaaS applications.

> This is a living repository — every lesson, task, and project is committed here as part of my growth as a professional software engineer.
